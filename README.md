The credit for HTML and CSS goes to: https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/l3laze

I used this project as practice for my javascript skills rather than HTML and CSS. 

Learned more about DOM traversals and dom related methods

I found this project on a website called frontendmentor.io which provides a bunch of projects
for beginners to train their coding skills
